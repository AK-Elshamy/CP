## ðŸ§  Math Tips & Tricks

- gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, y âˆ’ kx) for any integer k (invariant under linear combination)
- gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b) (Euclid's algorithm core)
- If a divides b â‡’ gcd(a, b) = |a|
- gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a|, |b|); absolute values are safe to take
- If a and b are coprime â‡’ gcd(a, b) = 1 and lcm(a, b) = |ab|
- Key relation: |aÂ·b| = gcd(a, b) Â· lcm(a, b)
- gcd(a, b, c, â€¦) can be reduced sequentially: g = gcd(a, gcd(b, gcd(c, â€¦)))
- lcm(a, b, c, â€¦) can be reduced sequentially: L = lcm(a, lcm(b, lcm(c, â€¦)))
- gcd(a, 0) = |a| and lcm(a, 0) = 0
- gcd(a, b) = gcd(a âˆ’ b, b); in general, operations that preserve common divisors are valid

### 1. GCD Invariance Property

- gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b âˆ’ a) and symmetric forms
- Helps reduce expressions like gcd(a, n âˆ’ 1 âˆ’ a) to gcd(a, n âˆ’ 1)

### 2. Coprimality (gcd = 1)

- If gcd(x, y) = 1, then x and y are coprime
- Often ensures uniqueness or coverage in modular arithmetic
- Useful for modular inverses and generating complete residue systems

### 3. Modulo Symmetry

- If a and n are coprime, then the set {a, 2a, 3a, â€¦, (n âˆ’ 1)a} mod n is a permutation of {1, 2, â€¦, n âˆ’ 1}
- Core trick behind many modular permutation problems

### 4. Work With n âˆ’ 1 Instead of n

- When indices run 0..nâˆ’1, nâˆ’1 often becomes the key divisor
- Example: reduce gcd(a, n âˆ’ 1 âˆ’ a) to gcd(a, n âˆ’ 1)

### 5. Using GCD for Constructions

- To cover all residues mod n with step s, require gcd(s, n) = 1
- If gcd(s, n) â‰  1, you only cover a fraction of residues

### 6. Reduction Habit in Number Theory

- Always try to reduce using:
  - gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, y % x)
  - Symmetry of a % n
  - Factorization of n

### 7. Check Small Cases First

- Test n = 2, 3, 4, 5â€¦ to observe patterns before generalization

### Golden Principle

- In modular arithmetic and constructive number theory, coprimality plus gcd tricks usually determine whether a construction works or fails
